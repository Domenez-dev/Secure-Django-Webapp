# HTTPS Support

## Overview
HTTPS ensures secure communication over the network by encrypting data.

## Djangoâ€™s Protection Mechanisms
- **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT**: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE**: Ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE**: Ensure CSRF cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

## Example
```python
# settings.py
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

## Best Practices
- Obtain and install an SSL/TLS certificate.
- Enable HTTPS settings in Django.
- Regularly monitor and update your SSL/TLS configuration.
